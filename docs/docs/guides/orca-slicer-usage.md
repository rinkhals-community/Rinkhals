title: Orca Slicer Usage
---

This guide covers only the printers: Kobra 3, Kobra S1 (Combo) because only those have presets in OrcaSlicer. 

For this guide, I will use the Kobra S1.

Download and install the latest OrcaSlicer application from: [Official OrcaSlicer Repo](https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/releases)

!!! warning Important

    Do not use websites like "orcaslicer.net", "orcaslicer.co" or "orca-slicer.com" as those are not the official websites.

Make sure you have Rinkhals installed on your printer. 

For the installation of Rinkhals, use [this guide](../about/installation-and-firmware-updates.md).

When you first start OrcaSlicer, you will be prompted to select a printer preset. Look for your printer and the nozzle type you are using.

Now you have a bare setup for your printer. 

We are now setting up the network service so you don’t need to use an SD card to print.

Click the **Connection** button in the printer section on the left side.

Enter the local IP address of your printer and click the **Test** button.

!!! note Tip

    Ensure your printer has a static IP address configured on your router to avoid connection issues.

Leave the other fields empty.

If you see this message, you are done with setting up the network.

🛠️ **Troubleshooting** 🛠️  
If you encounter this error:

![Cannot Connect Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickeetz/Rinkhals/master/docs/docs/assets/orca-guide/Cannot-Connect-Port80-Orca.png)

Make sure your computer is connected to the same network as your printer. 
Also, ensure you are using Fluidd or Mainsail as a WebUI and have the necessary apps for those services activated.

Click **OK** on the settings screen.

Now you should be able to open the Mainsail (or Fluidd) WebUI with a click on the **Devices** tab in the upper-left corner of Orca.

The WebUI should look similar to this:

![Mainsail WebUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rickeetz/Rinkhals/master/docs/docs/assets/orca-guide/Orca-Mainsail-WebUI.png)

You can now slice your prints and send them off to your printer 🖨️ 😊✌️

You are done with setting up your printer on OrcaSlicer with the basic settings.

## Best Practices and Troubleshooting

**"Timer too close" errors or MCU Starvation**
If your printer suddenly halts with a "Timer too close" error during prints:
- **Decrease G-Code Resolution:** Go to Print settings > Precision and increase the **Max Deviation** value. Highly detailed arcs or circles can spawn too many tiny segments that overwhelm the printer.
- **Turn off Dynamic Cooling:** Go to Filament settings > Cooling. Disable "Dynamic overhang cooling" or minimize the frequency of fan speed changes. Rapid temperature/fan adjustment commands (`M106` / `M160`) interleaved with tight G-Code movements easily overload the host communications.

**Anycubic Slicer Next ACE Connection Issues**
If you are using Anycubic Slicer Next (based on Orca) and experience errors where the slicer fails to detect the ACE unit or complains about ACE status, ensure your firmware is updated to **Rinkhals 20260501_01** or later, which completely resolves the `ACE missing` error logic payload from Slicer Next.

**Happy Printing!**
