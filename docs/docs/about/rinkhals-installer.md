## Download and use the Rinkhals Installer

From the GitHub [Releases](https://github.com/rinkhals-community/Rinkhals/releases) page, find the version you want and download the installer.swu matching your printer model.
As detailed in the [installation](./installation-and-firmware-updates.md) page, copy the .swu file as update.swu on a FAT32 USB drive. Then plug into the printer.

The installer takes about 10s to start. Once started, a SSH server will be listening on port 2222.

The main screen will show you some diagnostics results. You can tap on those to display more details and to apply the appropriate fix.

### Manage system versions

!!! warning

    A couple of things to keep in mind:

    - Downgrading firmware is not recommended as other printer components could be incompatible with the version you want to downgrade to.
    - When upgrading, if your installed Rinkhals version is not compatible with the new version it will not work properly

![](../assets/rinkhals-installer/installer-updates-system.png){ width="160", align=right }

This screen shows the installed system firmware and all available firmware versions from a mirror server: [https://rinkhals.thedju.net](https://rinkhals.thedju.net)

The installer will also check directly with Anycubic servers if a new version not yet mirrored is available.

Tapping on one version will allow you to upgrade or downgrade depending on your selection.

The version will be downloaded, extracted and then installed on your printer. The printer will then reboot to your new Firmware installation.
During the installation process, the installation will be patched in order for Rinkhals to survive the OTA process.
